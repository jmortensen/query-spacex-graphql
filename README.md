Welcome to a small example of using GraphQL and React to query SpaceX's API

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start:all` 

which runs both: 

### `yarn start` &  `yarn server`

at the same time. 

`start` builds and runs the React code and `server` is a small proxy Express server written to get around CORS restrictions during development

Once you've issued the above command the app will open in  development mode. <br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See this [section](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) about deployment for more information.
